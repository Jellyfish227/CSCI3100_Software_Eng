# Kaiju Academy Backend Implementation

## Why Rust for Backend Development

Rust was selected as the primary backend development language for Kaiju Academy for several compelling reasons:

### Safety and Reliability
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model eliminates entire classes of bugs related to memory management at compile time without requiring a garbage collector
- **Concurrency Without Data Races**: Rust's type system and borrow checker enforce thread safety, critical for handling multiple concurrent users
- **Error Handling**: Rust's Result and Option types force explicit error handling, reducing unexpected runtime failures

### Performance
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Rust provides high-level abstractions without performance penalties
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Critical for serverless environments where computing resources directly impact costs
- **Low Latency**: Delivers response times meeting our 2-second load time requirement for 95% of users

### Modern Language Features
- **Type System**: Helps prevent bugs through strong typing
- **Async/Await**: Built-in support for asynchronous programming simplifies handling concurrent connections
- **Ecosystem**: Growing library ecosystem with excellent web frameworks (Actix-Web, Rocket, Axum)

### Long-term Maintainability
- **Explicit Code**: Rust code tends to be explicit about its intentions, making it easier to understand and maintain
- **Refactoring Confidence**: The compiler catches many potential issues during refactoring
- **Documentation**: Strong culture of documentation in the Rust ecosystem

## AWS Serverless Architecture

The backend is implemented as a serverless solution on AWS, offering scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency:

### Core AWS Services

1. **AWS Lambda**
   - Hosts our Rust functions for API endpoints
   - Automatic scaling to handle varying load
   - Pay-only-for-what-you-use model reduces costs during low-traffic periods

2. **Amazon API Gateway**
   - RESTful API interface for our Lambda functions
   - Request validation and throttling
   - API versioning and documentation
   - Handles authentication with AWS Cognito

3. **AWS Cognito**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Implements OAuth2 support as specified in requirements
   - Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Role-based access control for different user types (student, educator, admin, moderator)

4. **SurrealDB on Amazon EC2/ECS**
   - Primary database for complex course data and relationships
   - Deployed using container services for easy scaling
   - Schema as defined in dbinit.surql

5. **Amazon S3**
   - Storage for course materials, videos, PDFs
   - Integrated with CloudFront CDN for efficient content delivery

6. **AWS Lambda Layers**
   - Shared code and dependencies across Lambda functions
   - Reduces duplication and deployment size

7. **Amazon CloudWatch**
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Alerts for performance issues or errors
   - Tracks metrics against our 99.9% uptime requirement

8. **AWS Step Functions**
   - Orchestrates complex workflows like course creation, grading
   - Maintains state for multi-step processes

### Backend Implementation Details

   - Material consumption and completion marking
   - Personalized learning paths

4. **Assessment System**
   - Quiz creation and management
   - Automated grading for MC and coding questions
   - Manual grading workflow for short-answer questions

5. **Code Execution Environment**
   - Secure sandboxed execution of user code

#### Key Backend Components

##### Lambda Function Handler

Our Lambda functions handle API Gateway requests through a consistent pattern:

```rust
async fn function_handler(event: LambdaEvent<ApiGatewayProxyRequest>) -> Result<ApiGatewayProxyResponse, Error> {
    // Extract the request, route to appropriate handler, return response
}
```

##### Domain Models

Domain models use Rust's type system for data integrity:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct User {
    pub id: Option<Thing>,
    pub email: String,
    pub role: UserRole,
    pub created_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

##### Authentication System

JWT-based authentication with role support:

```rust
fn generate_token(user_id: &str, role: &str) -> Result<String, AppError> {
    let claims = Claims { sub: user_id.to_string(), role: role.to_string(), exp: expiry, iat: now };
    encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_bytes()))
}
```

##### Error Handling

Strongly typed error handling with HTTP conversion:

```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum AppError {
    #[error("Authentication error: {0}")]
    Authentication(String),
    #[error("Authorization error: {0}")]
    Authorization(String),
    // Other error types...
}
```

##### Database Connection

SurrealDB connection with environment configuration:

```rust
pub async fn get_db_client() -> Result<Arc<Surreal<Client>>> {
    let db = Surreal::new::<Ws>(&connection_string).await?;
    db.signin(Root { username, password }).await?;
    db.use_ns(&namespace).use_db(&database).await?;
    Ok(Arc::new(db))
}
```

##### AWS Infrastructure 

Infrastructure defined with AWS CDK:

```typescript
const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'KaijuAcademyVPC', { maxAzs: 2 });
const cluster = new ecs.Cluster(this, 'KaijuAcademyCluster', { vpc });
```

#### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Request Flow**
   - Client request → API Gateway → Lambda → Database → Response
   - Authentication checks occur at the API Gateway level
   - Authorization checks happen within Lambda functions

2. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - SNS/SQS for asynchronous processing
   - EventBridge for system-wide events
   - Reduces coupling between components

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - ElastiCache/DAX for frequently accessed data
   - Browser caching for static content
   - Helps meet performance requirements for response times

#### Security Implementation

1. **Data Protection**
   - All data encrypted at rest using AWS KMS (AES-256)
   - TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing

2. **Access Control**
   - Fine-grained IAM policies
   - Least privilege principle throughout
   - SurrealDB permissions aligned with application roles

3. **Code Safety**
   - Input validation at API gateway and application layers
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Sandboxed code execution environment

#### SurrealDB Integration

The SurrealDB schema (as defined in dbinit.surql) is deployed and managed as part of our infrastructure. Key integration points:

1. **Database Access Layer**
   - Rust crates for SurrealDB connectivity
   - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
   - Retry mechanisms for resilience

2. **Data Models**
   - Rust structs mapped to SurrealDB tables
   - Serialization/deserialization with Serde
   - Type-safe query building

3. **Migration Management**
   - Version-controlled schema changes
   - Blue/green deployment for schema updates
   - Automatic backups before migrations

## Deployment and CI/CD

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - AWS CDK/CloudFormation for infrastructure definition
   - Reproducible environments for development, testing, and production

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated testing on every commit
   - Static analysis and linting
   - Security scanning

3. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Automated deployment pipeline
   - Canary deployments to reduce risk
   - Rollback capability

## Scalability and Performance

1. **Automatic Scaling**
