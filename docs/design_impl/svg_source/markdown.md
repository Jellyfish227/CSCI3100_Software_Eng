## 10.2. Evaluation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Performance Under High Load  
**Description**:  
This scenario evaluates the system's ability to handle 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation. The goal is to ensure that 95% of user requests are served within 2 seconds, even under peak load conditions.

**Steps**:  
1. **10k Concurrent Users**: Simulate 10,000 users accessing the platform simultaneously.  
2. **API Gateway Routes Requests**: Requests are routed through Amazon API Gateway to the appropriate backend services.  
3. **Lambda Scaling**: AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle the increased load, ensuring no single point of failure.  
4. **SurrealDB Read Replicas**: SurrealDB uses read replicas to distribute query load, optimizing response times.  
5. **95% ≤2s Response**: The system achieves the performance goal, with 95% of requests completing within 2 seconds.

**Key Metrics**:  
- **Response Time**: ≤2 seconds for 95% of requests.  
- **Scalability**: AWS Lambda and SurrealDB sharding ensure horizontal scaling.  
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime maintained during peak load.

### Scenario 2: Testability  
**Description**:  
This scenario evaluates the system's testability, focusing on code coverage and the ability to mock external services for isolated testing. The goal is to ensure that the codebase is maintainable and reliable, with ≥95% test coverage and the ability to test components independently.

**Steps**:  
1. **Code Coverage**:  
   - **JaCoCo Integration**: JaCoCo is used to enforce ≥95% test coverage during CI/CD builds.  
   - **Unit Tests**: Unit tests validate core logic, such as parsing algorithms, without relying on external services.  

2. **Mockable Services**:  
   - **Decouple HTTP Fetching**: External dependencies (e.g., RSS feeds) are decoupled from parsing logic. For example, `FetchBikingPicturesJob` separates HTTP fetching (`DailyFratzeProvider`) from parsing.  
   - **Isolated Testing**: Mock `DailyFratzeProvider` to test parsing logic in isolation, ensuring tests pass without internet connectivity.  

**Key Metrics**:  
- **Test Coverage**: ≥95% enforced by JaCoCo.  
- **Mocking Capability**: External services are mockable, enabling isolated testing of core logic.  
- **Maintainability**: Modular design ensures easy updates and refactoring.

### Key Takeaways:  
1. **Performance**: The system meets the SRS requirement of supporting 10,000 concurrent users with ≤2s response times for 95% of requests.  
2. **Testability**: High test coverage (≥95%) and mockable external services ensure a maintainable and reliable codebase.  
3. **Alignment with Files**:  
   - **Database.pdf**: SurrealDB’s read replicas and indexing support high performance.  
   - **SRS**: Performance and testability requirements are directly addressed.  
   - **Backend.pdf**: AWS Lambda and Rust’s error handling ensure scalability and reliability.
