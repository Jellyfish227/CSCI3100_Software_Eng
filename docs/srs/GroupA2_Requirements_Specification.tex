Kaiju Academy is a web-based e-learning platform that provides interactive programming education through modern LMS capabilities and specialized coding features, facilitating the learning of programming anytime and anywhere as long as you are connected to the internet.\\

The platform serves as a comprehensive learning environment where students can engage with programming concepts through a structured curriculum. Users access the platform through web browsers, eliminating the need for software installation reducing the barrier to entry for users. \\

The platform employs a module-based learning approach, where content is organized into discrete units that build upon each other. Each module typically contains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Video lectures with synchronized transcripts
    \item Interactive coding exercises
    \item Supplementary reading materials
    \item Practice problems and assignments
    \item Progress assessments
\end{itemize}

Students can track their progress through a personalized dashboard, which displays completed modules, upcoming assignments, and achievement metrics. The integrated code editor allows students to practice coding directly within the browser, with immediate feedback and automated grading capabilities. \\

Educators can utilize the platform to create courses, manage course materials and provide targeted assistance where needed. They could also answer questions from students in the discussion forum. The system's analytics tools help identify areas where students may be struggling, enabling educators to provide additional teaching resources. The platform features automated grading and feedback for assignments, allowing educators to have more flexible arrangement.
