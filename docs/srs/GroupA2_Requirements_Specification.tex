\chapter{Overall Description}
\section{Product Overview}
% $<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
% For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
% family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
% product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
% requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
% identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
% components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
% interfaces can be helpful.$>$

Kaiju Academy is a web-based e-learning platform that provides interactive programming education through modern LMS capabilities and specialized coding features, facilitating the learning of programming anytime and anywhere as long as you are connected to the internet.\\

The platform serves as a comprehensive learning environment where students can engage with programming concepts through a structured curriculum. Users access the platform through web browsers, eliminating the need for software installation reducing the barrier to entry for users. \\

The platform employs a module-based learning approach, where content is organized into discrete units that build upon each other. Each module typically contains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Video lectures with synchronized transcripts
    \item Interactive coding exercises
    \item Supplementary reading materials
    \item Practice problems and assignments
    \item Progress assessments
\end{itemize}

Students can track their progress through a personalized dashboard, which displays completed modules, upcoming assignments, and achievement metrics. The integrated code editor allows students to practice coding directly within the browser, with immediate feedback and automated grading capabilities. \\

Educators can utilize the platform to create courses, manage course materials and provide targeted assistance where needed. They could also answer questions from students in the discussion forum. The system's analytics tools help identify areas where students may be struggling, enabling educators to provide additional teaching resources. The platform features automated grading and feedback for assignments, allowing educators to have more flexible arrangement. 

\section{Product Functionality}
% $<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
% perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
% (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
% understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
% related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
% or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards 
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout 
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on 
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.  
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of 
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface 
specification.$>$

\section{Use Case Model}
$<$This section is the direct continuation of section 2.3 where you have specified 
the general use cases. Here, you should list in detail the different use cases. 
$>$
\subsection{Use Case \#1}
$<$Describe the use case in detail.$>$

\subsection{Use Case \#2}
$<$Describe the use case in detail.$>$


\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don't really say "System Feature 1." State the feature name in just a few 
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the 
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements 
associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.  
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user 
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.  
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or 
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, 
verifiable, and necessary. Use "TBD" as a placeholder to indicate when necessary 
information is not yet available.$>$

$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a 
meaningful tag of some kind.$>$

REQ-1:	REQ-2:

\section{System Feature 2 (and so on)}


\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
$<$If there are performance requirements for the product under various 
circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the 
developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the 
timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific 
as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual 
functional requirements or features.$>$

\section{Safety Requirements}
$<$Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or 
harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or 
actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to 
any external policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the 
product's design or use. Define any safety certifications that must be 
satisfied.$>$

\section{Security Requirements}
$<$Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use 
of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define 
any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or 
regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any 
security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.$>$

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
$<$Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be 
important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: 
adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, 
maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, 
and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when 
possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, 
such as ease of use over ease of learning.$>$

\section{Business Rules}
$<$List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or 
roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not 
functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional 
requirements to enforce the rules.$>$


\chapter{Other Requirements}
$<$Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\addchap{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
a single project in each SRS.$>$

\addchap{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
diagrams.$>$

\addchap{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
$<$Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.$>$
