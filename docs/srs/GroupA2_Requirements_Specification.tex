\chapter{Overall Description}
\section{Product Overview}
Kaiju Academy is a web-based e-learning platform that provides interactive programming education through modern LMS capabilities and specialized coding features, facilitating the learning of programming anytime and anywhere as long as you are connected to the internet.

The platform serves as a comprehensive learning environment where students can engage with programming concepts through a structured curriculum. Users access the platform through web browsers, eliminating the need for software installation and reducing the barrier to entry for users.

The platform employs a module-based learning approach, where content is organized into discrete units that build upon each other. Each module typically contains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Video lectures with synchronized transcripts
    \item Interactive coding exercises
    \item Supplementary reading materials
    \item Practice problems and assignments
    \item Progress assessments
\end{itemize}

Students can track their progress through a personalized user profile, which displays completed modules, registered courses, recommended courses, and achievement metrics. The integrated code assessment editor allows students to practice coding directly within the browser, with immediate feedback and automated grading capabilities.

Educators can utilize the platform to create courses, manage course materials, and monitor student progress. The system enables educators to update course modules, manage course content, and view taught courses with a sidebar of categories.

A new platform feature is the credit system, which allows users to purchase course access via payment and credits.

\end{itemize}



% In System Features, add a subsection at the end:
\section{Licence Management}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
Licence management is a high-priority security and access control feature. Users must enter a valid licence key before accessing any features beyond the login screen.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Action}: Attempts to access the system without a licence key.\\
          \textbf{System Response}: Prompts the user for a licence key.
    \item \textbf{User Action}: Enters an invalid licence key.\\
          \textbf{System Response}: Displays an error message and denies access.
    \item \textbf{User Action}: Enters a valid licence key.\\
          \textbf{System Response}: Grants access to the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must prompt for a licence key after login and before accessing course content.
    \item Licence keys must be validated against a server-side list or algorithm.
    \item Invalid or missing keys must result in denied access.
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional Requirements}
