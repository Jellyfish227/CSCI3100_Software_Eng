\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Document Purpose}
$<$Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, 
including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is 
covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a 
single subsystem.$>$
TODO: Write 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of this document as explained above

\section{Project Scope}
$<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. 
TODO: 1-2 paragraphs describing the scope of the product. Make sure to describe the benefits associated with the product.
$>$

\section{Intended Audience and Document Overview}
$<$Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers (In your case it would probably be the "client" and the professor). Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.$>$

\section{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
$<$Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.
TODO: Please provide a list of all abbreviations and acronyms used in this document sorted in alphabetical order
$>$

\section{Document Conventions}
$<$In general this document follows the IEEE formatting requirements. Use Arial font size 11, or 12 throughout the document for text. Use italics for comments. Document text should be single spaced and maintain the 1" margins found in this template. For Section and Subsection titles please follow the template. 

TODO: Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. Sometimes, it is useful to divide this section to several sections, e.g., Formatting Conventions, Naming Conventions, etc
$>$

\section{References and Acknowledgments}
$<$List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may 
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements 
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide 
enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, 
including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.$>$

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functionality}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
$<$Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.  
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product 
functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational 
level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.  
Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
most important user classes for this product from those who are less important 
to satisfy.$>$

\section{Operating Environment}
$<$Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the 
hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software 
components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.$>$

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
$<$Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the 
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware 
limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other 
applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel 
operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the 
customer's organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered 
software).$>$

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
$<$List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the 
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial 
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating 
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions 
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to 
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for 
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$

\section{User Documentation}
$<$List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, 
and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any 
known user documentation delivery formats or standards.$>$


\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
$<$Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software 
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards 
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout 
constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on 
every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.  
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of 
the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface 
specification.$>$

Kaiju Academy will have a graphical user interface (GUI) designed for ease of use and accessibility across different roles, including students, educators, and administrators. The UI components include:
\begin{description}
    \item[$\cdot$ Dashboard:] Upon login, users will be presented with a dashboard displaying their enrolled courses, upcoming deadlines, progress tracking, and notifications.

\end{description}

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
$<$Describe the connections between this product and other specific software 
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, 
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or 
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.  
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to 
documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols.  
Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data 
sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a 
global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an 
implementation constraint.$>$

The system will integrate with various software components to ensure smooth operation and functionality. These include:
